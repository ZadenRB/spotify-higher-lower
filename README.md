# spotify-higher-lower-api

This is the backend for [spotify-higher-lower-frontend](https://github.com/ZadenRB/spotify-higher-lower-frontend), a
guessing game where the player must guess if Spotify songs are more or less popular than one another.

The backend provides an endpoint to fetch a random spotify song via a randomly generated search query and a random
offset in the results. It returns the song title, popularity, and album image that are needed for the game.
