# spotify-higher-lower-frontend
The frontend for a guessing game where the player must guess if Spotify songs are more or less popular than one another.

The frontend makes requests to [the backend](https://github.com/ZadenRB/spotify-higher-lower-api) for random songs, and displays the popularity rating of one song, while hiding it for another, and the player must guess if the second song is more or less popular than the first.
